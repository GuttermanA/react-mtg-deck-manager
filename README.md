# Spellbook: A Card, Deck, and Collection React Web Application for Magic the Gathering

This is a React web application built alongside and for use with the API found [here](https://github.com/GuttermanA/spellbook-api). The genesis of this project was to build a better deck and collection manager for Magic: The Gathering. Many of the most popular websites are sluggish and out of date, so I thought I would attempt make modern deck builder using React.

Features include:
* Login with authentication
* View their saved decks and card collection
* View other user's decks
* Perform full CRUD action on their decks and collection
* Search a database of nearly 20,000 Magic cards
* Search for user decks
* Build deck or add to collection from card search results page
* Build deck or add to collection from collection page
* Copy existing user decks to your account
* Edit in place from deck show page
